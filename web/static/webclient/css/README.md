### webclient.css

The main webclient CSS file. This is the one you want to modify!

### keybinds_small.css

Defines the grid layout for the on-screen keybinding buttons. If you want to customize the layout of the visible buttons, this is the place.

(An alternate file with a layout matching the full keypad is in the works.)

#### xterm256.css

This is a compatability file to handle evennia's default class-based parsing of ANSI/XTERM colors to HTML. Unless you're completely reimplementing that whole core system, just let this one sit here.
